TournamentMango is an open source tournament bracket and user management system. You can build an archive of players and keep track of all their scores over time (as well as their regular characters, games, and aliases).

You can also create and manage events and tournaments. An event is essentially a group of tournaments, but an event isn't necessary to create a tournament.

Currently, the bracket generator supports single elimination, double elimination, free for all, group stage (round robin), and masters (a FFA subtype).
